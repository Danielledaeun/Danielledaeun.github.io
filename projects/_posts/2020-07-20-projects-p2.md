This post will be elaborating the whole process and thoughts on the building prediction models with imbalanced data. Due to the confidential issue, the details on data will not be provided, however, I am quite sure that you will get the gist of my work at the end of reading this post!

## Introduction
Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease(COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. As it's *chronic*,   people want to find the ways to keep patients from the **acute** case.  Acute cases can occur several times for a patient and this project want to predict whether the patients will be facing acute case using their previous medical records and the air pollutant information.

Amid all of the concerns on building decent prediction models, the main concerns on this project was *to tackle the imbalanced problem*. Since the acute cases are relatively rare compared to the ordinary COPD cases, *almost about less than 10%*, some resampling methods are considered. 

## Analysis Flow

Roughly, the analysis followed the process above. Usually, the **Data Preparation** takes the longest time and it should be. As there is nothing like free gift : you should set the variables(dtypes), most of the time you should create ones, and set your target with fine and accurate definition.  

Personally, defining the variables and even selecting what data sets to use in analysis is the most difficult part for me.

## Data Preparation
It should be natural at least to list some variables' name in the data set (for the sake of both credibility and  the convenience of explanation), however, it will not be provided in this post due to it's confidential. All that I can provide for the further elaboration is that the data set contains almost every medical records of COPD patients in South Korea, which are medications usage, symptoms, types of clinics, hospitalisations and so on.
